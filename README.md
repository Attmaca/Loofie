## 🛠 Engineering Approach

This project is not just app development, but an exercise in building a **sustainable and scalable software architecture**.

### 🏗 Software Architecture 
Designed to be change-resilient and technology-agnostic.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic is completely isolated from database or UI.
*   **Technology Agnostic:** Database or service providers used today can be swapped tomorrow without breaking the core application.
*   **Testability:** Each module can be tested independently.

### 🎨 User Experience Process
*   **Iterative Design:** Interface continuously improved based on user feedback.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Prioritized rendering performance for a "jank-free" experience.
*   **Accessibility:** Intuitive navigation designed for diverse user profiles.

### 🔧 Technical Competencies
*   **State Management:** Reactive and type-safe state management.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Modular and manageable dependency structure.
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Optimized background processes and data streams.
